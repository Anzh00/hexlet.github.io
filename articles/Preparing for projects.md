# Preparing for projects

Useful tips

Projects are run on your computer, not in the Hexlet environment, so you need to set up a development environment.

# Operating system

Most web applications are developed for Linux-based servers, so [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) and similar systems will be the most suitable for development. MacOS will also work. Below are the initial setup recommendations for each operating system.

Ubuntu or another Linux system

* Ready to work 'out of the box'

macOS

* Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) as your primary package manager
* Install iterm2

Windows

* First option: install [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
* Second option: install [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview)

# Command Line

Being able to work on the command line is very important for a programmer. Be sure to take the ["CLI fundamentals"](https://hexlet.io/courses/cli-fundamentals) course and practice working in Bash before starting your project.

# Git

Working with the version control system is an integral part of the development process. Take our ["Git fundamentals"](https://hexlet.io/courses/intro_to_git) course.

We also advise checking out some additional resources:

* [Interactive Git course on GitHub](https://try.github.io/)
* [ProGit book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
* [Working with branches, interactive learning](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=en_EN)

# Github

[Github](https://github.com/) — is an online service for hosting projects which use Git. Almost all open source software can be found on this service, and a GitHub account is the calling card of a professional developer. Before you start a project, create your account and link it to Hexlet [in the settings](https://hexlet.io/account/profile/edit).

# Code Editor

We recommend using the completely free [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Don't forget to add plugins for your tasks and your stack.

# Programming Language

Make sure that you have the current version of the interpreter installed. Be sure to check the official documentation, as operating system repositories often contain outdated versions.
