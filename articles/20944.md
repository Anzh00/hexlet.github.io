Projects FAQ

# Projects FAQ

Useful tips for completing projects

If you can't find the answer to your question, write to support@hexlet.io

# What should I do if I have any difficulties during the project?

Explore other students' questions and answers on the project page in the Discussion section.

If you are studying on your own, you can also ask questions in the "Discussions" - another student or the Hexlet support team will answer.

If you're studying with a tutor, ask him.

You can also ask questions in our [Slack](https://slack.hexlet.io/) community in the #hexlet-projects channel.

# How long does it take to check a project?

Automated tests check the project in a few minutes, and you see your results immediately. When working with a tutor, the additional review time is 2-3 days. If your tutor cannot meet this deadline, they will warn you.

# Is there a time limit for projects?

You can complete a project at your own pace. We recommend completing the project 4 weeks in advance. The project must pass the autotests, or be accepted by a tutor if you are studying with a tutor

# Can I start with the second project and skip the first?

No. Projects can only be done in order, starting with the first. Only when the previous project has been accepted can you move on to the next.

# Can I go through the project on my own without a tutor?

Yes. Projects with an automatic test checker and linter can be taken if you are studying without a tutor.

# Do I have to pay for projects?

The cost of the projects are already included in the tuition. There is no extra charge.

# What is the point of doing projects?

Projects simulate the workflow (setting a problem, finding a solution, implementation, and refactoring) and prepare you for real-world development. Read our article on why projects are important in learning - <https://hexlet.io/blog/posts/anatomy-of-hexlet-projects>.

# Can I use the project in my developer's portfolio?

Yes, of course. This is your personal project, published in your GitHub. Show it to employers and refer to it in your resume - it will be a serious advantage.
