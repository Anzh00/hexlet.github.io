The teacher's solution does not work

# The teacher's solution does not work

What to do?

Our system is designed so that an exercise cannot appear on the site if the teacher's solution does not work. If you copied the teacher's solution, but the check still does not pass, then make sure that you did not accidentally delete any code fragments or change the code in other files.

You can always return the exercise to its original state. To do this, click "Reset" in the menu on the right.
