# Timeframe for learning a text program

Recommendations

He most important thing in the learning process is consistency. The key to success is asking questions when needed and not wasting time. This document will help you understand the approximate time frame for each type of task and when you should ask for help.

# The learning process

Every week there is a group debriefing to see who is on what stage, what people found difficult and what questions they have. This is necessary to help deal with students' accumulated debt and to set topics for the tutor's activities, while following the schedule.

# Program

Before you begin, we recommend that you review your learning [program](https://hexlet.io/programs) again. Go to the program page, find the detailed description there, look at the order of the modules and what each of them reveals. Open each project and read what they include. This will help students better understand the learning objectives and outcomes at each stage.

# Learning plan

Study your program and see how many modules it consists of. Each module concludes with a project. Let's say the program runs for 10 months and has 5 projects. The recommended learning plan, then, is 2 months for 1 module **on average**, of which:

* 2-4 weeks for all courses before the project;
* 2-4 weeks to complete the project;
* up to 2 weeks to finalize the project by code review from the tutor.

The most important thing in the learning process is regularity and consistent progress. We recommend taking **an average of 2 to 5 lessons per day**. The lessons consist of theory, quiz and practice. But there are also lessons which are solely theory.

## Lessons

To average **no more than 60 minutes per lesson**, you need to pay attention to time:

* If it has been **20 minutes with no progress** in doing the exercise.
* When the exercise is done, but the solution time exceeds 60 minutes. Even the biggest Hexlet tasks do not take an hour of continuous coding.

## Project

Each project reinforces the topics from the module, so be consistent, going through the projects as soon as you complete the module. **For each step of the project,** we also recommend spending **a few hours of hard work** and no more than 60 minutes on your own to overcome any difficulties.

# What to do if you get stuck and can't solve the problem?

When you're stuck and you can't progress **for an hour**, can't see alternatives or can't deal with any bugs, read the discussions. If there is no answer there either, post your question in the group chat and ask your classmates or tutor to help solve it. Or you can create a discussion topic and attach a link in the chat.

The main thing is not to interrupt the learning process. Sitting around for hours thinking about a problem, googling solutions but not asking for help, is the least beneficial scenario.

## Tips on the website

As you learn, you will find various clues:

* interface elements;
* links to additional materials;
* independent assignments;
* discussions in exercises and projects;
* [Hexlet's reference](https://help.hexlet.io/en).

Use all of them to be productive.

At the end of each theory section, there's a block on how to deal with complexity:

Each practice has a "Hint" window, which describes the algorithm of actions and the optimal time:

Study these texts and come back to them every time you encounter difficulties.

# What should I do if I don’t have enough time to complete?

If you missed a few days of learning for any reason, don't worry. Write to your community manager. He will analyze the situation and tell you what stage you need to be at today.

There are always moments of slowing down or speeding up as you learn. Technical debt and the wrong approach often inhibit learning. But there are also life situations that throw you off your game. We always go out of our way to help students get to the end and overcome any difficulties.

So talk to your tutor and community manager as soon as problems appear, so they don't snowball and pile up.
